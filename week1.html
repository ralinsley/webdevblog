        <p>It's working! Hopefully as the semester goes by each of these blog posts will become progressively more and
            more
            readable and pleasing to look at,
            because as you can seeâ€“ it's about as basic as possible! This week has been very formative. I've very
            little (basically none) experience with html and front-end web design so I'm very glad to be going over the
            basics of html this week. </p>
        <p>I've learned some basic conventions in modern html regarding preferred style and accessibilty for people who
            use
            screen readers and a lot of terminology. While much of it was read about it, not
            much
            has been put to practice yet, and so this first blog post may have a lot of missing conventions. I learned
            about html entities which is the way to escape out and display characters that usually have a reserved
            meaning within html <br>For example: &lt;<br> Normally '&lt' is reserved to indicate a tag. </p>
        <p>Overall, this first week was a broad overview over the basics of html in order to give everyone a solid
            foundation to start the rest of the semester from.</p>
